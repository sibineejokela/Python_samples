## Python_samples

This repository was created to hold samples of code I've done using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This is what can be found in the folders:

1. **GDP & Life Expectancy** - Uses Seaborn to visually compare these variables for 6 different countries between 2000 - 2015
2. **Middle Class Income** - Uses Requests to scrape a webpage and Matplotlib to visualize middle class income ranges by state in groups (singles, couples, families of four)
3. **Netflix Stock** - Uses Matplotlib (& Seaborn) to visualize stock data 
   * quarterly distribution, actual vs. estimated, revenue vs. earnings, and against the Dow Jones average
